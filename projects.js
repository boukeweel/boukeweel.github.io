    //                         My most recent project is a personal experiment where I explore different types of AI behaviors by creating a simulation of a small-scale economy.\n
    //                         The goal was to design an economy that resembles real-life systems as closely as possible, while also testing which AI behaviors could best replicate or sustain it.\n
    //                         I was inspired by games like Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord and Europa Universalis IV, particularly in how they handle trade systems, and wanted to take a deeper dive into those mechanics through my own simulation.

                            We created a game where players compete against their friends to see who can complete exercises the fastest.\n
                            With this project, our team won the school’s game jam competition.\n
